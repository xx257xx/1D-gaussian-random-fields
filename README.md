# Generator of 1D gaussian random fields

it generates gaussian random fields on circle (which means periodic grf)

there are two kinds of covariances 
1. covariance_1 : covariance is form of k*exp(-|x-x'|)
2. covariance_2 : covariance is form of k*exp(-|x-x'|^2)

you can add your own custom covariance
